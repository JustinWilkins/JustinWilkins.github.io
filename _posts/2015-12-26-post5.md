• Discord Bot

Discord is a free voice and text communication service like skype. The difference between skype and discord is that discord will have "rooms" or servers where you can host a voice and text chatroom. These servers are usually dedicated to a community of people.

Discord bots help organize and moderate a server, I developed a discord bot that helps moderate my server and also a bunch of other commands such as, being able to search Wikipedia straight through the bot, and welcoming a user when they join the server. This was all developed with python. I'll be creating a github, for this to store all future development but for now I have bigger projects to work on.
